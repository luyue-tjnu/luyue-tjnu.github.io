# Welcome to Yue Lu's Homepage (卢 越) 

I am currently a lecture at School of Mathematical Sciences of Tianjin Normal University. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in 2007 and 2010 from Soochow University, respectively. In fall of 2011, I become a Ph.D Candidate in Dalian University of Technology, where I spent four years with Prof. Liwei Zhang in Operations Research and Control Theory.
